# javaAlarmClock‚è∞

This is a simple alarm clock program that runs in the CLI! 

## How does it work?

It's super simple, but quite useful. 

First. you enter a time in the format of HH:MM:SS. After that, the program will display the time in that same format and will show you the seconds moving towards your set alarm time. 

When the alarm hits, it will play the very well-known and beautiful verse of the Quran, Ayatul Kursi, in the voice of the famous Omar Hisham Alarabi. The audio will loop endlessly until you hit enter and end the program.

## Try it now!
```git clone git@github.com:alsaeedd/javaAlarmClock.git```

Then run the **main** method in your IDE of choice and enjoy!
